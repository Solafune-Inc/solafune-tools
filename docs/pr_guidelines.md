## **Guidelines for Submitting Community Tools and Other Pull Requests either in solafune_tools.community_tools or improvement of other tools.**

1. **Accessibility**
    1. All submitted tools must be in a form that is easily accessible by other users within the solafune_tools.community_tools namespace.
    2. Clear documentation, including usage examples and any required dependencies, must be provided to ensure ease of adoption by the community.
2. **Structure and Design**
    1. Tools should follow functional or object-oriented programming paradigms.
    2. If a tool consists of multiple functionalities, it must be encapsulated within a class or module for better organization and maintainability.
    3. Tools should adhere to standard coding practices, including clear naming conventions, modularity, and maintainability. This ensures consistency and ease of understanding for future contributors.
3. **Language Compatibility**
    1. Tools can be developed in any programming language, provided they can be called and executed seamlessly from the solafune-tools Python implementation.
    2. If non-Python tools are used, a Python wrapper or bridge must be included, along with instructions for its integration.
4. **Originality and Compliance**
    1. Tools must be original code authored by the user. Assistance from generative AI is permitted but must be acknowledged in the toolâ€™s documentation or comments.
    2. Direct copy-pasting from existing open-source software is not allowed.
    3. For tools inspired by or implementing concepts from papers or open-source software:
        1. Proper attribution and citation of the original work are mandatory.
        2. The submission must comply with the licensing terms of the original work.
5. **Quality Assurance**
    1. Tools must be thoroughly tested before submission.
    2. Unit tests and example scripts should be included to demonstrate functionality and verify reliability.
    3. Tools should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to guide users in troubleshooting.
6. **Violation and Consequences** \
   If a tool is found to be plagiarized or in violation of licensing terms:
   1. It will be removed from the project repository.
   2. If the user wins any award, prize money, or recognition (e.g., certificates, trophies), they must return these awards.
   3. The user will be disqualified from the award competition, and the award will be reassigned to a deserving participant.
7. **Collaboration and Community Engagement**
    1. Users are encouraged to collaborate with others in the community, leveraging shared knowledge and feedback to improve their tools.
    2. Tools should provide a clear contact point (e.g., GitHub repository, email) for reporting issues or suggesting improvements.
8. **Submission and Review Process**
    1. Submissions will undergo a review process by a panel of maintainers or selected community members to ensure compliance with the guidelines.
    2. Feedback on necessary changes or improvements will be provided during the review process.
    3. Approved tools will be merged into the official solafune_tools.community_tools repository.
