# Spectral Indices Calculator

## Description
A utility module to calculate common satellite spectral indices, specifically NDVI (Vegetation) and NDWI (Water), from input band arrays.

## Impact to the data and Example of the dataset
**Impact:** These tools allow users to instantly generate feature layers for machine learning models. NDVI is critical for crop classification and deforestation monitoring, while NDWI is essential for flood detection.

**Best Data:** Sentinel-2 or Landsat imagery.
- **NDVI:** Requires Red and NIR bands.
- **NDWI:** Requires Green and NIR bands.
